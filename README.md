# Python Workout

Based on Reuven Lerner's Python workout, this repo is a simple collection of ten-minute exercises to sharpen Python skills by testing various core topics.

The topics are broken down into:

-   Numeric types
-   Strings
-   Lists and tuples
-   Dictionaries and sets
-   Files
-   Functions
-   Functional programming with comprehensions
-   Modules and packages
-   Objects
-   Iterators and generators

All solutions are my own.
